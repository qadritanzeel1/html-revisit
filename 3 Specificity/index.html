<!-- Problem Statement:
Experiment with CSS specificity to understand how rules are applied based on specificity values. Style the same element using different selectors (element, class, and ID) and observe which style takes precedence.

Requirements:
Create a <div> element with the class highlight and ID special.
Write CSS rules for the <div> using an element selector, a class selector, and an ID selector, each with different colors.
Observe which color is displayed based on CSS specificity and explain why that color is shown. -->
