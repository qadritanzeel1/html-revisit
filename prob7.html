    <!-- Use CSS combinators to style elements based on their hierarchical relationships. In this task, you'll use both descendant and child combinators to create targeted styles within a nested structure. The goal is to apply different styles to direct child elements compared to those deeper in the hierarchy.

Requirements:
Create a <div> element containing a <p> and another nested <section> that also includes a <p>.
Use a descendant combinator to style all <p> elements inside the <div> in blue text.
Use a child combinator to style only the <p> element that is a direct child of <div> with a bold font weight. -->
